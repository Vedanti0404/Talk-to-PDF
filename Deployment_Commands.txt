QUESTION: WHAT IS A VM? 
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based simulation of a physical computer. It allows you to run an operating system and applications just like on a real computer, but within a virtual environment on a physical machine. This enables multiple VMs to share the same hardware resources, making it easier to manage and use them efficiently.

sudo (short for "superuser do") is a command in Linux that allows a permitted user to execute a command with the privileges of another user, usually the superuser (root). This is often used to perform administrative tasks that require higher permissions.

STEP 6: cd folder name

now inside that folder.

STEP 7: sudo apt install python3-pip

STEP 8: pip install numpy pandas stremlit pickle (No need for sklearn and matplotlib as model is already trained.)

Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution. It is a specific version of the Linux operating system, designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.

Linux refers to the "underlying kernel" that forms the core of the operating system. It's the foundation that various distributions (like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian) are built upon.

In essence:
- Linux is the kernel.
- Ubuntu is a complete operating system that includes the Linux kernel and additional software, making it a Linux distribution.
